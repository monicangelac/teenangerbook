Given the level of hormones and emotion they are dealing with, as well as the lack of patience they often have for parental authority, it isn't always easy to know how to react when you see their anger coming up.</p><p>It is crucial to put in mind that anger is not always a bad thing. When their parents are around, they'll occasionally get angry over things the teen has no control over. It's not necessarily a reflection of how they really feel about these situations. And given what we know about teen evolution, there is often an end-goal goal in many of these situations that can be of great benefit to the family as a whole.</p><p>It's all about choices. Choices that are based upon how you have treated your teen with respect and understanding. It's a natural, healthy, and necessary part of the emotional process that they're going through to become an adult fully. More on this later.</p><p>As parents, we have the ability to guide these decisions in a positive way that allows our kids to grow up to be self-sufficient and happy adults. But it's not always easy, and it can be downright painful at times. The first step in dealing with all of this is to understand that you're not the only one going through this process. It's a long road for both of you, filled with pain, joy, frustration, and learning.</p><p>As parents we also deal with a lot of different emotions when our teens get angry. We can begin to feel as though we are no longer needed and that we have not succeeded at what we set out to do when they were born. This is how it feels at the time; I guarantee it.</p><p>To help your teen cope with anger, you have to understand what it is that they are angry about. Getting angry is a natural reaction to events in their life. We get angry with our kids when we see that they're doing things that are harmful and destructive to themselves, their lives, and the people around them. But most often the source of anger doesn't come from nowhere. In reality, it's a result of something you did or didn't do in the past that your teen has been holding on to for some time.</p><p>What your child is really saying when they get angry with you, is that they are trying to reach out to you. Your child knows how much you love them and want them to be happy. They also know what they did in the past that caused their anger in the first place. What our kids are always trying to tell us is how much they are hurting inside and need our help. By taking this knowledge and applying it, we can begin to really understand why our teens act the way they do around us. Learning about the signs of teen anger and knowing how to deal with it can be beneficial for your teen in the long run. Understanding that anger can be a positive force in the life of our kids is the first step in understanding it and learning to cope with it. Let's look at what we can do to guide them to make choices that will allow them to grow into responsible, successful adults.</p></div></div><div class="container buy-bottom-cta text-center"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TEEN-ANGER-Guide-parens-parents/dp/B0959N61B6/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" title="Buy Teen Anger: Guide for Parents"><img class="amazon-buy-white" src="dist/assets/img/buy-book-amazon-white.webp" width="100%" alt="buy book on Amazon"></a></p></div><div class="container"><hr class="divider"></div><footer class="container"><p>&copy; 2021 Joseph Moore & Pamela Moore</p></footer></main></body></html>
